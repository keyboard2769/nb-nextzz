- ya not guilty

- shame on the guy who polluted my insanity

## todo list

#### plan

- [ ] $ tre
- [ ] $ dos
- [ ] $ uno
- [ ] $ current slot overwhelming coloring
- [ ] $ maybe feeder flux have to be a 'double-linear' model by its evil naturally ?
        .. say, you've got a model composed as (100rpm, 10tph, 900rpm, 60tph)
        .. speed under 100rpm have to compromise a model
        .. that composed as (0rpm, 0tph, 100rpm, 10tph), which is a different model
- [ ] $ let feeder ratio adjust based on tph value
- [ ] $ refine case test of pid controller to have target manipulation
- [ ] $ a linear pane with blocks of 'zero' and 'span' button
- [ ] $ holding mixer gate screws log and weight control up
- [ ] $ the gate simulation and the case of cut point handling
- [ ] $ for translation, we should eliminate any in-loop 'tr' usage
- [ ] $ and maybe we should re-implement the dry-wet control with a stepper
        .. to eliminate all those flags? .. after you made the file system done
- [ ] $ for weigh control manager, may every matt tagged stuff get merged
        .. i mean , get merged into a 'controller' class or something
- [ ] $ maybe we need to let the feeder speed box send manual pulse
- [ ] $ over sized stuff should get located near the sixth bin
- [ ] $ fill v provision and combust motor load factor
- [ ] $ complete the error list and log mechanism

#### heading

- [ ] $ lets reclaim the setting pane and its content and translate 
- [ ] $ add current slot overwhelming setting

#### last

- [x] $ the mixer content pl can flash now .. and it s out of control ! 
- [x] $ we just gave up on the 'fixing' thing of the auto-weigh-sequence
- [x] $ shift-tab can now back shift the focus .. don't push to hard !!
- [x] $ let the dynamic weigh result table shine
- [x] $ added the "linear setting" to THE list
- [x] $ the zero adjusting stuff works now more than likely
- [x] $ partly did the TRD logging and root verifying stuff
- [x] $ partly did the weigh logging and export-before-quitting stuff
- [x] $ print button can send some file to printer now
- [x] $ move feeder assistance switch to feeder pane
- [x] $ feeder group ratio button works based on the the flux setting item
- [x] $ feeder flux setting representation needs another floating point
