- shame on the guy who polluted my insanity

## todo list

#### plan

- [ ] $ tre
- [ ] $ dos
- [ ] $ uno
- [ ] $ a linear pane with blocks of 'zero' and 'span' button
- [ ] $ holding mixer gate screws log and weight control up
- [ ] $ the gate simulation and the case of cut point handling
- [ ] $ for translation, we should eliminate any in-loop 'tr' usage
- [ ] $ and maybe we should re-implement the dry-wet control with a stepper
        .. to eliminate all those flags? .. after you made the file system done
- [ ] $ for weigh control manager, may every matt tagged stuff get merged
        .. i mean , get merged into the 'controller' class
- [ ] $ maybe we need to let the feeder speed box send manual pulse
- [ ] $ over sized stuff should get located near the sixth bin
- [ ] $ fill v provision and combust motor load factor
- [ ] $ move feeder assistance switch to feeder pane
- [ ] $ feeder flux setting representation needs another floating point
- [ ] $ current slot overwhelming color and setting
- [ ] $ complete the error list and log mechanism
- [ ] $ refine case test of pid controller to have target manipulation

#### heading

- [ ] $ the log and file stuff

#### last

- [x] $ local inputtive box color is preferred to dark orange .. cool yeah
- [x] $ fixed final batch display cleaning thing aka the name box problem
- [x] $ flag manipulating action needs pulse control actually
- [x] $ the mixer content pl can flash now .. and it s out of control ! 
- [x] $ we just gave up on the 'fixing' thing of the auto-weigh-sequence
- [x] $ shift-tab can now back shift the focus .. don't push to hard !!
- [x] $ let the dynamic weigh result table shine
- [x] $ added the "linear setting" to THE list
- [x] $ the zero adjusting stuff works now more than likely
